Bit Level Simple Simulator -- BLeSS, is a simple bit level wireless network simulator. It is a discrete event driven simulator, written in C. And it make uses of GSL, ComLinC, IT++ etc.

It is designed to be extensible and easy to use with OO-concepts.

Since nowadays most network simulators (ns-2, OMNET++, QualNet,...) are all essentially packet level simulator -- which make PHY layer engineers feel uncomfortable, BLeSS comes with a ``true'' PHY layer simulator.
